                     <p>
                        It was on a dreary night of November
                        <br>that I beheld <del>

                        <del>And</del>
                        <br>with an anxiety that almost amount<br>ed to agony I collected instruments of life
                        <br>around me <del>and
                           endeavour to</del>
                        <sup>that I might</sup>

                        <br>that lay at my feet. It was already
                        <br>one in the morning, the rain pattered
                        <br>dismally against the window panes, &amp;
                        <br>my candle was nearly burnt out, when
                        <br>by the glimmer of the half
                        extinguish<br>ed light I saw the dull yellow eye of
                        <br>the creature
                        open<del>.</del>
                        <sup>â€”</sup>It breathed hard,
                        <br>and a convulsive motion agitated
                        <br>its limbs.

                        <del>But how</del> How can I
                        describe my
                        <br>emotion at this catastrophe; or how deli<br>neate the wretch whom with such
                        <br>infinite pains and care I had endeavoured
                        <br>to form. His limbs were in proportion
                        <br>and I had selected his features <del>h</del> as

                        scarcely covered the work of
                        <br>muscles and arteries beneath; his hair
                        <br>was <sup>of a lustrous black

                        The different accidents of life are
                        <br>not so changeable as the feelings of hu<br>man nature. I had worked hard for
                        <br>nearly two years for the sole purpose
                        <br>of infusing <del>h</del> life into an inanimate
                        <br>body. For this I had deprived myself of
                        <br>rest and <del>heath</del> health. I had desired
                        <br>it with an ardour that far exceed<sup>ed</sup>
                        <br>moderation; but now that I had succeed<br>ed these dreams vanished and breathless
                        <br>horror and disgust filled my heart.
                        <br>Unable <sup>to endure</sup> the aspect of the <del>creature</del><sup>being</sup> I
                        <br>had created, I rushed out of the room and 
                        <br><del>remained</del><sup>continued</sup> a long time traversing my 
                        <br>bed chamber unable to compose my
                        <br>mind to sleep. At length <del>sl</del><sup>l</sup>assitude
                        <br>succeeded to the tumult I had before 
                        <br>endured, and I threw myself on my
                        <br>bed in my clothes endeavouring to seek
                        <br>a <del>feew</del> few moments of forgetfullness.
                        <br>But it was in vain; I slept indeed but
                        <br>I was disturbed by the wildest dreams --
                        <br>I saw Elisabeth <sup>in the bloom of health</sup> walking in the streets of
                        <br>Ingolstadt; delighted &amp; surprised I embraced
                        <br>her but as I imprinted the first kiss
                        <br>on her lips they became lurid with
                        <br>the hue of death; her features appeared
