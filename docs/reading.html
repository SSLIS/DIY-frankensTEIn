                     <p>
                        It was on a dreary night of November
                        that I beheld <del>
                           <sup>the frame on whic</sup></del>

                        <del>And</del>
                        with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony I collected instruments of life
                        around me <del>and
                           endeavour to</del>
                        <sup>that I might</sup>

                        that lay at my feet. It was already
                        one in the morning, the rain pattered
                        dismally against the window panes, &amp;
                        my candle was nearly burnt out, when
                        by the glimmer of the half
                        extinguished light I saw the dull yellow eye of
                        the creature
                        open<del>.</del>
                        <sup>â€”</sup>It breathed hard,
                        and a convulsive motion agitated
                        its limbs.

                        <del>But how</del> How can I
                        describe my
                        emotion at this catastrophe; or how delineate the wretch whom with such
                        infinite pains and care I had endeavoured
                        to form. His limbs were in proportion
                        and I had selected his features <del>h</del> as
                        <del>handsome</del>

                        scarcely covered the work of
                        muscles and arteries beneath; his hair
                        was <sup>of a lustrous black

                        sockets in which they were set,

                        The different accidents of life are
                        not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for
                        nearly two years for the sole purpose
                        of infusing <del>h</del> life into an inanimate
                        body. For this I had deprived myself of
                        rest and <del>heath</del> health. I had desired
                        it with an ardour that far exceed<sup>ed</sup>
                        moderation; but now that I had succeeded these dreams vanished and breathless
                        horror and disgust filled my heart.
                        Unable <sup>to endure</sup> the aspect of the <del>creature</del><sup>being</sup> I
                        had created, I rushed out of the room and 
                        <del>remained</del><sup>continued</sup> a long time traversing my 
                        bed chamber unable to compose my
                        mind to sleep. At length <del>sl</del><sup>l</sup>assitude
                        succeeded to the tumult I had before 
                        endured, and I threw myself on my
                        bed in my clothes endeavouring to seek
                        a <del>feew</del> few moments of forgetfullness.
                        But it was in vain; I slept indeed but
                        I was disturbed by the wildest dreams --
                        I saw Elisabeth <sup>in the bloom of health</sup> walking in the streets of
                        Ingolstadt; delighted &amp; surprised I embraced
                        her but as I imprinted the first kiss
                        on her lips they became lurid with
                        the hue of death; her features appeared
