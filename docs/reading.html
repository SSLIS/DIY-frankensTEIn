                     <p> 
                        It was on a dreary night of November
                        that I beheld <strike>
                           <sup>the frame on whic</sup></strike> 
                        my man comple<strike>te</strike><sup>ated</sup><strike>.</strike><sup>,</sup>
                        <strike>And</strike>
                        with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony I collected instruments of life
                        around me <strike>and
                           endeavour to</strike>
                        <sup>that I might</sup>
                        <strike>e</strike>

                        that lay at my feet. It was already
                        one in the morning, the rain pattered
                        dismally against the window panes, &amp;
                        my candle was nearly burnt out, when
                        by the glimmer of the half
                        extinguished light I saw the dull yellow eye of
                        the creature
                        open<strike>.</strike>
                        <sup>â€”</sup>It breathed hard,
                        and a convulsive motion agitated
                        its limbs.
                        
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>
                        <strike>But how</strike> How can I
                        describe my
                        emotion at this catastrophe; or how delineate the wretch whom with such
                        infinite pains and care I had endeavoured
                        to form. His limbs were in proportion
                        and I had selected his features <strike>h</strike> as
                        <strike>handsome</strike>
                        <strike><sup>handsome</sup></strike>

                        <sup>yellow</sup> skin
                        scarcely covered the work of
                        muscles and arteries beneath; his hair
                        was <sup>of a lustrous black
                           &amp;</sup> flowing and his teeth of a pearly whiteness but these

                        formed a more horrid contrast with his watry eyes that seemed almost of 
                        the same colour as the dun white 
                        sockets in which they were set,
